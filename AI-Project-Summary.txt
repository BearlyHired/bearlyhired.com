Bearly Hired — Project Summary

Bearly Hired is a professional social network built live, in public, using AI. It’s like LinkedIn — if LinkedIn took itself way less seriously and was built for actual humans, not "thought leaders."

Project Overview
----------------
A professional network that:
- Centers authenticity over performance
- Balances wit with usefulness
- Supports posting (text, image, video, polls), profiles, messaging, job listings, and newsletters
- Is fully open source
- Is built live on Twitch with full transparency
- Has strong overlap with the creator’s existing brand, Bearly Fit

Audience
--------
- Professionals who are burnt out on hustle culture
- People who hate performative LinkedIn posts
- Folks navigating modern work in a deeply unserious world
- Human beings > influencers
- Open source and dev-first communities welcome

The Problem We're Solving
--------------------------
LinkedIn is bloated with ego, cringe, and content that makes people feel gross.
Bearly Hired is a response to that — a place to be real, to share, and to connect without needing to “build a personal brand.”

- No corporate fakery
- No “influencer” energy
- No hustle worship
- Just people sharing what they're doing, making, or struggling with

Tone & Voice
------------
- Witty but not silly
- Cynically hopeful
- Burnout-aware
- Casually professional
- Emotionally employed

Sample taglines:
- "Professional. Barely."
- "Networking for the emotionally employed."
- "Just trying to make it to lunch."
